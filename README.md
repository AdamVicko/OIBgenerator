Terminal application that generates RANDOM valid OIB.

The Republic of Croatia introduced the Personal Identification Number (OIB) in the Croatian legal
system. The Ministry of Finance - Tax Administration is responsible for the assignation of the OIB to
every person as a unique and obligatory identifier in the whole Croatian public administration system.
Personal Identification Number is assigned to:
• Croatian citizens by birth or by acquisition of Croatian citizenship,
• legal entities based on the Croatian territory and the establishment
• foreign natural persons and entities when there is basis for their surveillance in the Republic
of Croatian (registration in public records and acquisition of the status of the taxpayer)
After 1 January 2009, to all new individuals will be assigned a personal identification number at the
moment of birth registration or acquisition of Croatian citizenship, upon establishment or the reason
for surveillance. Personal Identification Number will be assigned on the basis of information data
exchange between the bodies that enter records and Tax Administration, without having people come
to the Tax Administration.
